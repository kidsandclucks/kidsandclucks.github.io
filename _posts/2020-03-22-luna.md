Luna was the last born of 4 and significantly smaller than her brothers.  What she lacked in size she made up for in feistiness!!  She quickly caught up to her brothers in size and enjoys jumping and climbing...especially on people!  She is an F4 Mini nubian and we expect her to be an excellent milker one day considering her pedegree.

Potentially retained, dependent on rest of herd.

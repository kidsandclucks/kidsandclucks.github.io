“Phoenix” is a 5th generation mini nubian that we have had since she was a baby.  She is registered through the MDGA (Miniature Dairy Goat Association).  She never misses an opportunity to come see her people or call to you from her pen if she sees you.  She comes from excellent breeding lines and we expect her to be a great milker!  She is full of spots and has beautiful ears; we hope she passes both on to her kids!

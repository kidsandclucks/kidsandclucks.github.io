Nix was born third and slightly smaller than his brothers.  But he caught up to them quickly!  He is an F4 Mini nubian.  He is his sire's mini me!  He is adorable even with his crazy ear.   Some in the family call him "Lightning" to reflect the lightning bolt down his nose.

Price reflects he will be wethered at 10 weeks of age. Non-wether offers will be considered until then.

Titan was the second born and everyone's favorite almost immediately.  He has loved to climb into anyone's lap and take a nap any chance he can get.  He is spunky and cuddly, always the first to get to the food or milk.  He is an F4 Mini nubian and should throw amazingly adorable babies with good milking lines.

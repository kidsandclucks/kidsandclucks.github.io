“Sammy” is truly a cuddly puppy trapped in a goat’s body.  He is a 4th generation mini nubian from amazing milking lines.  He is registered through the MDGA (Miniature Dairy Goat Association).  As of 2019, he was one star daughter away from earning his milk star.  So far, he has blessed all of his kids for us with many moonspots!

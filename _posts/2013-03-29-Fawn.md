“Fawn” was our first milker.  She is a 3rd generation mini nubian.  She is registered through the MDGA (Miniature Dairy Goat Association).  She has been with us since she was 5 and has graced us with over 3 quarts of milk everyday, close to a gallon during her peak.  While she has not been tested, she has an older full sister that has a milking star.  She is an excellent mother and her first kidding with us she was able to feed all 4 of her kids with no assistance once they got the hang of nursing.  

She also never misses an opportunity to visit with her people and follows us around whenever we are in sight.

More information coming soon.
